A site for all digital illustration works
This project is my personal portfolio site for both myillustration/design skills. On this page you will find examples of my digital illustration pieces.

Tech used: HTML, CSS

Right now this is very simple site just simpley to diaply my works in a agreeable fashion, Later I hope to add a bit more functionality to the site

Optimizations

As I continue to refine my site I hope add a few CSS animations a long with a few more JavaScript functions to make the site more interactive and engaging.

Lessons Learned: Image sizing and using grid to find the best layout were the biggest challenges while working on this site.
